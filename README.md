# Node Express Handler

This application allows you to view burger order list, burger devoured list, and to add a burger to the order list. When you click "submit", your burger will be added to the menu list.

## Pseudo code to finish:

I would need to create a button with refrences to id and it's boolean for devour and delete
I would need the burger to move to the devoured list if the "devour button is clicked"
I would need the burger to move to the order list if the "re-order" button is clicked.
I would need the new burger added to the order list if "add burger" button is clicked.

I would need to add CSS and a burger image to complete the front end.
